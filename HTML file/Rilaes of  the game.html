    <h4>"In the peaceful Sicilian village of Salem, a dark presence is about to make itself known. For years, the family based crime organization known as the Mafia has been establishing itself in the foundation of the community. Until now, the naive citizens have been unaware of the evil among them. Tonight, however, the Mafia makes its move. Tonight, someone will die, and until the Mafia has eliminated all opposition, the innocent will continue to die. Unless, of course, the Mafia is destroyed first..."</h4>

    <div style="border: 1px solid black; width: 1500px; height: 170px;">The above is a typical opening for the game called Mafia (Also known as "Werewolves of Miller's Hollow" or "Town of Salem"). The game can be played by an indeterminate group of people, each playing the role of either a murdering Mafia member or an innocent townsperson, along with a game moderator. At the beginning of the game, Night falls, and the Mafia family members become aware of each other (by communication from the moderator). They then choose a victim, and the moderator announces the death scene. When Day breaks, the town must try to weed out the evil by eliminating someone they suspect to be mafia.
The game of Mafia (in Meat World) is usually run with playing cards representing the possible roles in the game. The moderator secretly distributes the cards to the players, then has everyone put their head down/close their eyes. During the Night, the moderator "wakes up" the mafia, and they silently choose a victim. During the Day, everyone discusses, argues, swears, and eventually votes for someone to eliminate. The cycle repeats until the endgame.
MafiaScum, however, is devoted to the online version of the game. The history of mafiascum.net can be traced back to a game moderated by mith in August 2000 on the Grey Labyrinth, a puzzle website. Due to the success and growth of the game on the GL, mith started mafiascum.net as a dedicated forum in March 2002. Online Mafia has the potential for more strategy and subtlety because it removes most of the possibility for cheating and provides players with a chance to form suspicion based on logic and voting patterns instead of facial expression. It also has the potential for just as many (if not more) laughs, because the players can act however they like, no matter how shy they might be in real life.
